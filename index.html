                    <h2>What is Mechanically Challenged?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mechanically Challenged is a monthly challenge hosted by
                        MooNiZZ and Captain Coder's Academy in which members of
                        the community recreate different mechanics found in
                        games! The goal is to create a library of references and
                        examples for these mechanics in as many different
                        engines and languages as possible.

                                This month's mechanic is... <b>Dropping through platforms</b>!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is a very common mechanic in 2D Platformers
                                where you can stand on a platform, hold down, and
                                press jump to drop through the platform you're
                                standing on. Typically, from beneath the platform,
                                it is also possible to jump through the platform and
                                land on it.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Two $50 <b>Educational Mechanic</b> prizes will be
                                awarded: one by Captain Coder and one by MooNiZZ.
                                The selection process is at the sole discretion of
                                the judge. The judges will be looking for clean
                                implementations that can be utilized by new
                                developers to implement the mechanic.
