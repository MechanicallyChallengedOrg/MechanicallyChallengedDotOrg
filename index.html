          <h1>Mechanically Challenged</h1>
          <p>
            Mechanically Challenged is a monthly challenge hosted by MooNiZZ and
            Captain Coder's Academy in which members of the community recreate
            different mechanics found in games! The goal is to create a library
            of references and examples for these mechanics in as many different
            engines and languages as possible.

                <p>
                  In 2008, Jonathan Blow's puzzle-platformer Braid came to XBox and blew our minds with its
                  incredibly satisfying time manipulation mechanics!
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  In this month's challenge, you are tasked with implementing a <b>Rewind</b> mechanic that allows the
                  player to reverse all of their actions! Remember, the goal is to create a simple (and hopefully
                  elegant) solution that others can learn from and use.
                </p>
              
                <p><b>Bonus</b>: Create additional time manipulation mechanics.</p>

                <p>
                  17 years ago Valve released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/400/Portal/"
                    target="_blank">Portal</a>, a mind-blowing game for its time. Today, many
                  consider
                  it to
                  be a classic that that holds up very well today. The main mechanic in the game is
                  Portals! You can place 2 different portals anywhere and when you enter one of them
                  you
                  come out through the other, keeping your momentum and your rotation is changed based
                  on
                  the portals rotation!
                </p>

                <p>
                  The challenge for this month is to recreate the physics behavior of portals in a 2D
                  or
                  3D environment. Optional bonus points if you can recreate the visual and placement
                  behaviors.
                </p>

                <h3>Requirements:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Be able to go through a portal and come out through the other portal, both ways.
                  </li>
                  <li>Keep the momentum when you go through the portals</li>
                  <li>Rotate the player and objects that travel through the portals based on the
                    orientation of the portals.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Optional:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>The visuals! When you look at a portal it would be great to see through it!</li>
                  <li>Be able to place portals as a player</li>

                This month's mechanic is... <b>Special Platforms: Slopes and Loops</b>!
              </p>
              <p>
                The Sonic series made great use of special platforms to create
                twisting, winding, and fast paced levels! This included sloped
                platforms that allowed the player to accelerate while moving
                down and fight gravity while moving upward. Probably more
                iconic are the loops that Sonic uses to create a sense of
                movement and speed!
              </p>

              <p>
                This month, you are challenged to write an implementation for
                sloped platforms, looping platforms, or both! A few things to
                notice from the examples:
              </p>
              <p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The character sprite adjust to the angle of the slope
                </li>
                <li>
                  The character's velocity is affected by the slope: they slow
                  down going up and speed up moving down.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The character will slide down a slope that is too steep.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The character cannot make it through a loop if their
                  velocity is not great enough
                </li>
              </ul>
              </p>

              <p>
                Both 2D and 3D submissions are welcome! Additionally, it is up
                to you how you choose to implement this mechanic. However,
                entries that focus on simplicity, modularity, and code reuse
                are more likely to win an <b>Educational Mechanic</b> prize!

                This is a very common mechanic in 2D Platformers where you can
                stand on a platform, hold down, and press jump to drop through
                the platform you're standing on. Typically, from beneath the
                platform, it is also possible to jump through the platform and
                land on it.
