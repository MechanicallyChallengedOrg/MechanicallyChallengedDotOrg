                    <p>
                        Mechanically challenged is a monthly challenge in which members of
                        the community recreate different mechanics found in games! The goal
                        is to create a library of references and examples for these
                        mechanics in as many different engines and languages as possible.

                            This month's mechanic is... <b>Dropping through platforms</b>!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is a very common mechanic in 2D Platformers
                            where you can stand on a platform, hold down, and
                            press jump to drop through the platform you're
                            standing on. Typically, from beneath the platform,
                            it is also possible to jump through the platform and
                            land on it.
