                    <p>
                        Mechanically Challenged is a monthly challenge hosted by
                        MooNiZZ and Captain Coder's Academy in which members of
                        the community recreate different mechanics found in
                        games! The goal is to create a library of references and
                        examples for these mechanics in as many different
                        engines and languages as possible.

                                    This month's mechanic is... <b>Special Platforms: Slopes and Loops</b>!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Sonic series made great use of special
                                    platforms to create twisting, winding, and fast
                                    paced levels! This included sloped platforms
                                    that allowed the player to accelerate while
                                    moving down and fight gravity while moving
                                    upward. Probably more iconic are the loops that
                                    Sonic uses to create a sense of movement and
                                    speed!
                                </p>

                                    This month, you are challenged to write an
                                    implementation for sloped platforms, looping
                                    platforms, or both! A few things to notice from
                                    the examples:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        The character sprite adjust to the angle of the slope
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The character's velocity is affected by the slope: they slow down going up and
                                        speed
                                        up moving down.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The character will slide down a slope that is too steep.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The character cannot make it through a loop if their velocity is not great
                                        enough
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                    implement this mechanic. However, entries that focus
                                    on simplicity, modularity, and code reuse are more
                                    likely to win an

                            <p>
                                This is a very common mechanic in 2D Platformers
                                where you can stand on a platform, hold down, and
                                press jump to drop through the platform you're
                                standing on. Typically, from beneath the platform,
                                it is also possible to jump through the platform and
                                land on it.
