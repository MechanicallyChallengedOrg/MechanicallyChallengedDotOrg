<h1>Mechanically Challenged</h1>
<p>
    Mechanically Challenged is a monthly challenge hosted by MooNiZZ and
    Captain Coder's Academy in which members of the community recreate
    different mechanics found in games! The goal is to create a library
    of references and examples for these mechanics in as many different
    engines and languages as possible.

<h2>This Month's Challenge: Time Manipulation</h2>
<p>This months mechanic is <b>Time Manipulation</b>!</p>

<p>
    In 2008, Jonathan Blow's puzzle-platformer Braid came to XBox and blew our minds with its
    incredibly satisfying time manipulation mechanics!
</p>

<p>
    In this month's challenge, you are tasked with implementing a <b>Rewind</b> mechanic that allows the
    player to reverse all of their actions! Remember, the goal is to create a simple (and hopefully
    elegant) solution that others can learn from and use.
</p>

<p><b>Bonus</b>: Create additional time manipulation mechanics.</p>

<h2>Rules for Submission</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Playable Demo - This does not need to be a fully playable game. Instead, focus on creating a short demonstration of the game mechanic.</li>
    <li>Source Code / Project - You should include access to your project for the judges to review. This is typically a GitHub repository but may also be a downloadable archive.</li>
    <li>A written explanation of the mechanic implementation describing how others can utilize your approach. This may be a README on your GitHub repository</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> All submitted projects will become part of the Mechanically Challenged Archive and be distributed under an MIT License.</p>

<h2>Prize: Most Educational Mechanic</h2>
<p>
    Our Challenger will review all of the submissions with the judges: Captain Coder and MooNiZZ to determine which we
    believe is the <b>Most Educational Mechanic</b>. The winner will be eligible to receive $50USD via PayPal. Note: To
